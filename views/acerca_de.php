      <p class="parrafo">All of our products are hand made by experienced bakers using only the best, natural ingredients available to us. When our products are packed, they are either delivered in recyclable cardboard, or individually wrapped for ‘grab and go’ in fully bio-degradable and home compostable responsibly sourced packaging.</p>
      <p class="parrafo">All our products are made using flour from Wessex Mill, the small family run flour mill based in Wantage, Oxfordshire. They source and mill wheat from local farms within 30 miles of the mill. The finished flour is delivered to our bakery in West London, less than 50 miles away.</p>
      <p class="parrafo">All our products freeze well, best frozen on the day of purchase. Defrost by leaving the product at ambient and then use as normal, alternatively check the product details on the website for the best options to refresh or heat up.</p>
